# Low Level Design

## Database and Libraries

Our database of choice is PostgreSQL. We are using the psycopg library as an adapter to make PostgreSQL work with our Django project. 

## Overall Description

Our design is abiding by the principles of having a tightly coupled set of objects. This minimizes our use of object inheritance.

Similarly, it allows our objects to establish a one to one connection with their associated table in the database, allowing for single instantiations of objects to communicate directly with the database. 

The database adapter, namely models.py in the case of our Django project, provides factory methods to introduce functionality such as `getting`, `setting`, `deleting`, and `creating` system objects. These are private methods that allow our team to create objects with private constructors and return them for use within the rest of the system. This allows other teams within our track to use these objects for whatever purposes needed. We also have a public API with `get`, `set`, `add`, and `remove` methods for each system object that are visible to the other teams for their own uses. In this case, the database knows of the various objects within the system.

## Testing Plans

### Equivalence Testing/Partitioning

After we have implemented our unit testings for each unit method, we decided to proceed towards an equivalence testing suite. As a recap, the goal of equivalence testings is to split up the input domain ranges of each method into equivalent partitions, so as to only test on one possible object in that partition.  The idea is that by ensuring tests on one object in that range the method calls will work for all possible obejcts in that domain space.  There is one fatal problem with this testing method which is that just because two objects are supposed to be in the same class and act the same, doesn't necessarily mean that they will.  Thus, equivalence testing could miss those cases. Equivalence testing is typically performed on inputs due to having a larger domain of values, and not typically performed on outputs due to methods usually returning one type.  This will also help us pick out edge cases for we will have effectively mapped out all the domain ranges.  

For our database implementation, each user is unique for every user has their own, separate data. For example, the values of attribute fields for The `Member` object such as `name`, `email`, `date created`, etc. can effectively be whatever the user or person wants (with the exception to some edge cases detailed earlier).  There isn't much room to set up different equivalence classes/partitions since the users are all similar but with different data. The only case we thought of that would be partition into different equivalence classes is `Member`'s `user_type` attribute which can be `Member`, `Idol`, or `Admin`.  However, the testing approach for those differing fields would not be different. Thus, we have decided to approach the equivalence class testing for the database by essentially giving one equivalence class for each object such as `Member`, `Post`, `Comment`, etc.  By testing on two to three instances of those classes, we can show that the methods for `add`, `get`, `set`, and `remove` work for all objects in that equivalence class or essentially the entire object.

### Integration Testing

Our current integration testing is working with the web server teams to establish a reliable connection that allows us to establish a relationship with the model teams. 

A successful passing of this integration testing would result in model teams being able to successfully add and remove items from the database, where the items they add are not from our predefined unit tests.

Instead, we would be testing that there is a route of communication from the model teams, through the web server, then to our database. 

Similarly, we would test that there would be a connection that would allow the model teams to send a get call that would go to the web server, communicate with our database, and we would then return the specified item upon validation that it exists. 

### Unit Tests

Helper Functions: As is the case with the other object classes, we need to be able to create instances of each object and associated      objects following it in the hierarchy for testing purposes. We will use the following helper functions throughout our tests: 

   - `Create Member`: 
      - Preconditions/Parameters: `name, invitedBy` (optional)
      - Postconditions: Returns a `Member` object with the following parameters set: `visibility, invited_by, email, password, username, points, user_type, is_verified, birthday, address`
   - `Create Post`: 
      - Preconditions: `content, user` (optional)
      - Postconditions: Returns a `Post` object with the following parameters set: `user, url, is_flagged,content, by_admin`
   - `Create Comment`:
      - Preconditions: `content, user, post, replies` (optional) 
      - Postconditions: Returns a `Comment` object with the following parameters set: `user, post, replies, content, by_admin`  
   - `Create Credit Card`: 
      - Preconditions: `user
      - Postconditions: Returns a `CreditCard` object with the following parameters set: `user, card_num, cvv, holder_name, card_expiration, currently_used, address, zipcode` 
   - `Create Image`:
      - Preconditions: `user, post, image`
      - Postconditions: Returns a `Image` object with the following parameters set: `user, post, current_image, is_flagged, by_admin`
   - `Create Filter`:
      - Pre-Conditions: `image`
      - Post-Conditions: Returns a `Filter` object with the following parameters set: `image, filter_name`

### Member Test Cases

***Test Case #1: Creating a Member***

`test_create()`

Description: This case tests that the creation of a new `Member` works as intended.

Steps:

1. Create a new `Member` object. 
2. Verify that new `Member` created is an instance of `Member`. 
3. Verify that total count of Members is 1 - ensuring that new `Member` has been added.
Note: When the `Member` object was instantiated, it was set to a `Member` object - but this could just as easily have been `Admin` or `Idol`, as these do the same function as Member. Testing for `Member` shows it will work for `Idol` and `Admin`. 

***Test Case #2: Creating a Member***

`test_class_create()`

Steps:

1. Create a new `Member` object. 
2. Verify that new `Member` created is an instance of Member. 
3. Verify that total count of Members is 2 - ensuring that new `Member` has been added.
Note: When the `Member` object was instantiated, it was set to a `Member` object - but this could just as easily have been `Admin` or `Idol`, as these do the same function as Member. Testing for `Member` shows it will work for `Idol` and `Admin`.

1. Create a `Member`, `Post` and `Image` object.
2. Using the above objects as parameters, create a `Filter` object. 
3. Verify that the object count is equal to 1 (given an empty database). Ensure no duplicate. 
4. Verify that the `Filter` is the same instance/object as the `Filter` build through the API's `create` call. 
      
 ***Test Case #2: Setting a Filter Attribute***
 
 `test_edit()`
 
 Description: This case tests that the updating of a `Filter` object works as intended.
 
 Steps: 
1. Create a `Member`, `Post` and `Image` object.
2. Using the above objects as parameters, create a `Filter` object.
3. Set a new `Filter` `id`. 
3. Test that the updated `Filter` `id` is equivalent to the `id` retrieved from the database. 

### Important Cases and Edge Cases

   1. Ensure that data critical to a user's verification is stored correctly in the database
      - Ensure CreditCard attribute `card_num` is 16 digits
      - Ensure CreditCard attribute `cvv` is either 3 or 4 digits
      - Ensure CreditCard attribute `card_expiration` must be valid (and in the future)
      - Ensure `Member` attribute `birthday` contains month that is between numeric values 1 - 12
      - Ensure `Member` attribute `birthday` contains day that is between numeric values 1 - 30
      - Ensure `user` type is either `Member`, `Admin`, or `Idol`
   
   2. Ensure retrieving data from database table returns expected value
      - Ensure `id` is valid
      - Ensure the column retrieving from is in database table
      - Ensure the column retrieving from is filled and contains data
   
   3. Ensure updating a table updates the correct item
      - Ensure column exists
      - Ensure `id` is valid
      - Ensure all data is valid (see #1)
   
   4. Ensure deleting from a table entry removes from database
      - Ensure `id` is valid
